# AdventOfCode
My solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles.

I use different programming languages for each year. These are:
* 2015: C++
* 2016: Python
* 2017: Rust
* 2023: C#

See the readme in each year's folder for commands to run the solutions for that year (this assumes
you've installed any required compilers/runners/etc. for that language). If no additional arguments
are provided, it runs for every solved puzzle. If numeric arguments are provided, it instead runs
only for the days specified (e.g. for 2023, `dotnet run 7` runs only day 7's solver).
