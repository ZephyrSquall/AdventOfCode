# AdventOfCode
My solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles.

Solutions are written in C#. Run them with `dotnet run path-to-file.txt`, where `path-to-file.txt`
is the relative path to the .txt file containing the puzzle input. I like to put the puzzle input in
the same folder as the code under the name `input.txt`, in which case the command is `dotnet run
input.txt`.
